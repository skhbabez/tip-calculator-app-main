## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to write some more complex validation logic, using some of the refactoring logic taught on frontendmentor in the process.

```js
const validations = {
  bill: (bill) => isNumber(bill) && bill > 0,
  people: (people) => isNumber(people) && people % 1 === 0 && people > 0,
  tip: (tip) => isNumber(tip) && tip >= 0,
};
```

I am proud of the way I solved the tip button list and the custom button, ensuring they act in tandem.

```js
const resetToggles = () => {
  tipButtons.forEach((btn) => {
    btn.checked = false;
  });
};

const handleTip = (event) => {
  if (event.currentTarget.name === "tip") {
    customInput.value = "";
  }
  if (event.currentTarget.name === "tip-custom") {
    resetToggles();
  }
  updateResult();
};
```

### Continued development

I need to f√≥cus on writing cleaner code in css. While I like my solutions in geneal a lot better now, they still lack maintainability (especially when it comes to using custom properties). I am also not particularly happy with the way I wrote my javascript and I am looking for a cleaner solution handling the form state.
